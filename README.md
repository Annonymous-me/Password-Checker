In the event of a data breach, hackers often use brute-force dictionary attacks to log into user accounts by looping through the collection of compromised usernames and passwords (key:value pairs) until a successful hit is reached. 
This program enables you to privately check if any of your passwords have ever been hacked at the comfort of your terminal/command prompt. 
This approach is more secure as compared to keying in your password on https://haveibeenpwned.com


This program uses SHA1 concept with hashing.......
Simple yet effective program
Give a TRY!



Just run the main.py
Enter number of passwords you want to try!
Type those followed by pressing enter key!
You shall see the results!!
